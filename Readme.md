# microservice-security

> 👋 **Welcome, and thanks for scanning!** You've reached a live slice of my work — a small
> security microservice that registers users, signs them in, and keeps their sessions alive.
> If you have two minutes, the three specs below tell the whole story in plain English; no Java needed.

## What it does — three specs, in plain English

These are the project's **executable** specifications (Gherkin): the test suite (Cucumber) runs them
when you build the project, so the behaviour they describe is verified, not aspirational. The *same*
scenarios are driven from more than one entry point — **application** (the use-case objects),
**infrastructure** (real HTTP) and **UI** (a real browser, through Playwright): same behaviour, a
different way in. Each one reads like a short story:

- **[Registration](./specs/register.feature)**
  — a new user signs up with an email and a password; sign-up is refused when either is invalid,
  and the answer says *which* one.
- **[Authentication](./specs/authenticate.feature)**
  — correct credentials sign the user in; repeated failures from the same source temporarily
  lock it, to stop password guessing.
- **[Refreshing a session](./specs/refresh-session.feature)**
  — a user keeps a session alive by refreshing it; an expired or missing session can't be refreshed.

These three are just the highlights — **all 19 executable specs live in [`specs/`](./specs/)**,
also covering password reset, email change & verification, session management (logout, list,
revoke everywhere), refresh-token reuse detection, multi-factor sign-in (codes, TOTP, passkeys),
federated sign-in, roles, the password policy, runtime settings and account deletion (GDPR).

**[An Allure snapshot of the test runs lives here](./Documentation.md)** — a photograph of one
workspace-wide run (2026-07-02), kept for the shape of it rather than for the numbers. The living
documentation is the specs above and the value objects they exercise.

> **Project scope — what holds today.** The **Domain → Config → System** core is fully tested and
> self-documenting. **Infrastructure** is built: an HTTP controller per use case, an authorization
> filter, JDBC adapters over Flyway migrations (with in-memory ones that take over when no
> datasource is configured), and mail notifiers that reach a separate email microservice through a
> transactional outbox and Kafka. The **UI** is built too — a small React app that is also the
> specs' third entry point, driven by the same feature files through Playwright. Of the 20 specs,
> 17 run at the HTTP layer, 11 in a real browser and 6 at the application layer — the counts are
> held honest by tests that fail when a spec quietly stops being driven. The diagram below is the
> full target shape; the executable specs are what's actually proven — nothing here is hand-waved.

## Architecture — six layers, dependencies pointing down

A security microservice (registration, authentication, password hashing) built with
**Domain-Driven Design** and **Hexagonal Architecture**. Every layer may use the ones below it,
never the ones above:

```
UI  →  Infrastructure  →  Application  →  System  →  Config  →  Domain
```

### The three top layers — one behaviour, many doors

UI, Infrastructure and Application share the *same* BDD scenarios, but each implements them its
own way:

- **UI** — drives user interactions (fill a form, click).
- **Infrastructure** — expects data over the network.
- **Application** — translates between the outside world and the domain.

*Same behaviour, different entry point. The domain doesn't care how you reach it.*

### The core — proven, not promised

Proven by executable specifications (**jqwik** + **Allure**); concepts explained in Javadoc.

- **System** — composes Config + Domain into use cases. Within a use-case package the
  package-private steps carry a `_` prefix (e.g. `_BruteForceGuard`, `_VerifyCredentials`), so the
  package's public API stands out at a glance — a deliberate convention, see
  [ADR 0002](https://github.com/jrobertgardzinski/security/blob/main/docs/adr/0002-underscore-prefix-for-use-case-steps.md).
- **Config** — domain rules made configurable. Where a rule's value lives decides how fast a change
  takes effect: hardcoded needs a new release, properties (or program arguments) need a restart,
  persisted config takes effect instantly.
- **Domain** — self-validating value objects.

> **The rules are the tests, and the tests are the documentation — so it cannot drift.**

### Two payoffs of clean boundaries

- **Microservice or monolith — your choice.** This module is Domain → Config → System →
  Application → Infrastructure, with the UI on top.
  Making the boundaries explicit keeps the deployment shape — split into services or kept as one —
  an open decision.
- **Reusable as a library.** A library spans Domain → System, and its System and Config layers can be
  specialized per consumer. An email library, for instance, can ship strict System/Config for this
  security microservice, and separate, relaxed ones for other services (newsletters, notifications,
  RSS feeds).

## Requirements

| Tool  | Version    | Notes                                                                          |
| ----- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Git   | any recent | to clone the repositories                                                      |
| JDK   | **25**     | the project compiles against Java 25 (`maven.compiler.release=25`)             |
| Maven | —          | **not required** — every repository bundles a Maven Wrapper (`mvnw` / `mvnw.cmd`) that downloads the right Maven version automatically |

Check what you already have:

```bash
git --version
java -version
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Don't have Java 25 yet? Quick install per platform</strong></summary>

**Linux / macOS — via [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io) (recommended):**

```bash
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
sdk install java 25-tem      # Temurin JDK 25
```

**macOS — via Homebrew:**

```bash
brew install openjdk@25 git
```

**Windows — via [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/) (built into Windows 10/11):**

```powershell
winget install EclipseAdoptium.Temurin.25.JDK
winget install Git.Git
```

After installing, **open a new terminal** so the updated `PATH` is picked up.

## Clone & build the whole project

This microservice depends on sibling modules that live in separate repositories: `test-starter`,
`libs` (which holds the `constraint` artifact), `config`, `email`, `password`, `adjustable-clock`,
`infrastructure-micronaut-clock` and `offline-jwt`. The list used to name five of the eight, and a
build on a clean `~/.m2` simply failed on the first missing one — it is the same list CI checks
out, and the easiest way to keep it honest is `shared/estate.sh clone`, which clones the whole
estate from `estate/*.repos`.

The commands below clone them into one workspace folder and build them in order via the bundled
**Maven Wrapper** (`./mvnw`), installing each into your local Maven repository (`~/.m2`) so the
final build can resolve them. No system-wide Maven needed — the wrapper fetches the right version
on first run.

### 🐧 Linux &nbsp;/&nbsp; 🍎 macOS &nbsp;(bash / zsh)

```bash
mkdir security && cd security

for repo in test-starter libs config email password adjustable-clock \
            infrastructure-micronaut-clock offline-jwt microservice-security; do
  git clone "https://github.com/jrobertgardzinski/$repo.git"
done

for dir in test-starter libs config email password adjustable-clock \
           infrastructure-micronaut-clock offline-jwt microservice-security; do
  ( cd "$dir" && ./mvnw clean install ) || break
done
```

### 🪟 Windows &nbsp;(PowerShell)

```powershell
mkdir security; cd security

foreach ($repo in 'test-starter','libs','config','email','password','adjustable-clock',
                  'infrastructure-micronaut-clock','offline-jwt','microservice-security') {
  git clone "https://github.com/jrobertgardzinski/$repo.git"
}

foreach ($dir in 'test-starter','libs','config','email','password','adjustable-clock',
                 'infrastructure-micronaut-clock','offline-jwt','microservice-security') {
  Push-Location $dir
  .\mvnw.cmd clean install
  if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { Pop-Location; break }
  Pop-Location
}
```

When the last build finishes you have the whole project compiled and all of its tests
(the living specification) executed locally.

> 💡 **Faster build, skipping tests:** append `-DskipTests` to the wrapper command (e.g.
> `./mvnw clean install -DskipTests`). The tests run in just a few seconds, though — and they
> *are* the documentation — so running them is worth it.
