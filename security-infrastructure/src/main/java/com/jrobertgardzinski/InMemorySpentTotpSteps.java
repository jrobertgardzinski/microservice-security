/**
 * The highest TOTP step each enrolment has already spent, in memory. One entry per user who uses
 * TOTP, holding a single number; it is swept of anything older than an hour, because a step that
 * far in the past cannot be replayed anyway (the factor only ever looks one step either side of
 * now).
 *
 * <p>In memory like the rest of the short-lived MFA state: a restart re-opens a replay window of at
 * most 90 seconds, which is what this closes the other 99.9% of the time. A shared store takes over
 * if this service scales out — the same trade-off the pending-authentication store makes.
