/**
 * Resolves the {@link IpAddress} that brute-force protection treats as the request's source.
 *
 * <p>The source is the brute-force key and the key of every throttle, so it must be hard to spoof:
 * {@code X-Forwarded-For} is honoured <em>only</em> when the request actually arrived from a
 * configured trusted proxy (load balancer / reverse proxy); otherwise the connection's remote
 * address is used. This stops a client from forging an arbitrary source — and thus dodging its own
 * lockout — by sending an {@code X-Forwarded-For} header directly. Trusted proxies are configured
 * via {@code security.trusted-proxies} (a comma-separated list; empty by default).
 *
 * <p><b>Which element of the header is the client?</b> The rightmost one that is not ours. A proxy
 * APPENDS the peer it saw (nginx's {@code $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for}, ingress-nginx, Traefik), so
 * the list reads client, proxy, proxy — and everything to the LEFT of our own infrastructure is
 * whatever the caller chose to send. Taking the leftmost element therefore handed the caller its
 * own throttle key: rotate it and no limit ever bites, or write a victim's address and spend the
 * victim's failure window for them. So this walks the list from the right, skips every element that
 * is a trusted proxy of ours, and takes the first one that is not — falling back to the peer when
 * the list is empty, all trusted, or the candidate is not an IP address at all (a header saying
 * {@code unknown} used to reach the {@code IpAddress} constructor and answer 500 on every throttled
 * endpoint).
 *
 * <p>Entries are compared as exact addresses: a CIDR block in {@code security.trusted-proxies}
 * matches nothing. A deployment behind Kubernetes must therefore name the ingress pod addresses,
 * not the pod network.
 *
 * <p>An address is also CANONICALISED before it becomes anybody's key: the IPv6 zone id (the
 * {@code %eth0} part) is a hint about the local machine's interfaces, not about who is calling, and
 * the domain's validator accepts one of any length — which then does not fit the {@code VARCHAR(64)}
 * the failure log keys on. Two sources that differ only by zone id were also two different keys,
 * which is one throttle bucket each.
