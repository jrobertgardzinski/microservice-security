/**
 * HMAC-SHA256 under a server-held PEPPER — what the database holds for a recovery code.
 *
 * <p>Keyed rather than salted, and that is the design constraint rather than a preference: a code
 * is spent by looking its hash up, so every code must hash to the same value every time. A pepper
 * keeps that while making a stolen table worthless on its own — the attacker needs the key as well,
 * and the key is not in the database.
 *
 * <p>The pepper is deployment configuration ({@code security.mfa.recovery.pepper}). Under a
 * declared {@code prod} profile it MUST be set, for the same reason the datasource password must
 * (see {@link CredentialsFuse}): a default that ships in the repository is not a secret. In dev and
 * test a fixed value is used, so the stack starts with nothing to configure.
 *
 * <p><b>Changing the pepper invalidates every recovery code already issued</b> — they hash to
 * something else afterwards. So does arriving here from the old unkeyed digest: codes minted before
 * this class existed no longer match, and their owners must generate a fresh batch.
