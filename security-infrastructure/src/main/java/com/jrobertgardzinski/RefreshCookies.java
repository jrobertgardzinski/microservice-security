/**
 * Issues and reads the refresh-token cookie. The refresh token is delivered to the client only as
 * an {@code HttpOnly}, {@code SameSite=Strict} cookie — never in a response body — so it is out of
 * reach of page JavaScript (XSS) and not sent on cross-site requests (CSRF). {@code Secure} is on
 * by default (the cookie then rides only over TLS); it is turned off under the {@code test}
 * environment via {@code security.cookie.secure} so the cookie round-trips over plain HTTP in tests.
 *
 * <p><b>What SameSite does NOT cover.</b> It is a SITE rule, not an origin rule: a different PORT on
 * localhost and a sibling subdomain in production are the same site, so a page there can make the
 * browser send this cookie — and {@code POST /refresh} and {@code POST /logout} act on the cookie
 * alone, with no header a cross-site page could not set. In dev that is every other service on this
 * laptop; in production it is anything under the registrable domain. The cost is bounded by what
 * those two endpoints do (rotate a session, or end one — neither reads the response, which the
 * same-origin policy still hides), and the honest fix if that stops being acceptable is a
 * double-submit token on the refresh route rather than a stricter cookie flag, because there is no
 * stricter flag.
