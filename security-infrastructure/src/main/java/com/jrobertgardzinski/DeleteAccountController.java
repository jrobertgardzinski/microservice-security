/**
 * The ONE door out of an account, for the person whose account it is and for an administrator
 * closing somebody else's. Which of the two it is comes from the request itself — the address in
 * the path against the address in the token — and everything else follows from that comparison:
 * what must be proven, and whether the caller may say what happens to the content.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Your own account.</strong> A fresh step-up ({@link StepUpAction#DELETE_ACCOUNT}),
 *       and then everything you ever posted goes. This request IS the right to erasure, and the
 *       grounds on which content may survive such a request are enumerated by law — "the community
 *       up-voted it" is not one of them — so any conditions in the body are dropped, by
 *       {@link AccountClosure} itself rather than by this controller remembering to.</li>
 *   <li><strong>Somebody else's.</strong> The ADMIN role on top of the step-up
 *       ({@link StepUpAction#ADMIN_DELETE_ACCOUNT}), because this destroys another person's
 *       account and their content on one press. Nobody is exercising a right here — it is a ban,
 *       or house rules — so the caller MAY state a rule per content axis, and it rides the saga.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The two used to be two routes. One is closer to the truth: "am I closing my own account or
 * someone else's" is a property of the request, not of the URL, and the authorisation is what
 * follows from it rather than what picks it.
 *
 * <p>Protected: {@link AuthorizationFilter} has authorized the access token and published the
 * caller's email. Closing is a saga: {@link StartAccountDeletion} locks the account at once
 * (sessions revoked, sign-in refused) and asks the content services to purge; their confirmation —
 * not this request — deletes the account for good.
