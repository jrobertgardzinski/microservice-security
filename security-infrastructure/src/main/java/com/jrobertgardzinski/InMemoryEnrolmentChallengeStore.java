 * <p>Every entry carries its OWN deadline, because not every pending enrolment has a challenge to
 * borrow one from. A TOTP enrolment stores the generated secret and no challenge at all (the code
 * is computed from the clock, nothing is sent), so the sweeper — which read
 * {@code enrolment.challenge().isExpired(clock)} — threw an NPE on the first such entry and
 * abandoned the rest of the sweep, for everybody: abandoned TOTP secrets then lived for ever and
 * stayed confirmable, and so did every entry the sweep never reached.
