/**
 * Identity's side of the account-deletion saga — the ORCHESTRATION itself lives in the portal
 * ({@code microservice-offboarding}), because the content being purged is the portal's domain.
 * {@link #begin} locks the account (saga STARTED) and announces the FACT that deletion was
 * requested — through the outbox, so the fact commits with the lock; the fact ferries the
 * leaver's purge choices without knowing their vocabulary. The portal answers with ONE outcome:
 * {@link #completePurge} (the user is deleted for good, a goodbye mail goes out) or
 * {@link #compensate} (the account unlocks, an apology goes out). {@link #compensateOverdue} is
 * the safety net for a dead orchestrator: no outcome at all in time unlocks the account too.
 * All transitions are idempotent — at-least-once delivery makes duplicates a fact of life.
 *
 * <p>An identity-only deployment (no portal, e.g. security + the F1 game) sets
 * {@code account-deletion.await-portal-purge=false}: there is no content to purge anywhere, so
 * the account deletes immediately.
