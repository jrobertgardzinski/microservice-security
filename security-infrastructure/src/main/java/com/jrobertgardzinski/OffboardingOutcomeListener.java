/**
 * The saga's ear, after the extraction: identity no longer hears three content participants —
 * the portal's orchestrator (microservice-offboarding) collects those and announces ONE outcome
 * on {@code offboarding-events}. PORTAL_CONTENT_PURGED finishes the deletion for good;
 * PORTAL_PURGE_FAILED rolls the lock back and apologises. Everything else on the topic is not
 * ours. Idempotent by way of the claim on the outcome id.
 *
 * <h2>Why the delivery settings are spelled out</h2>
 * Idempotence protects against processing an outcome TWICE. It says nothing about processing it
 * ZERO times, and the defaults gave exactly that. Without an {@code errorStrategy}, an exception
 * out of {@code handle()} — the transaction rolling back on a momentary database hiccup is the
 * realistic one — was logged, the poll loop moved on, and {@code enable.auto.commit} committed the
 * offset anyway. The record never came back. Nothing else retries it either: the orchestrator's
 * sweeper stops re-announcing once ITS own outbox mark lands, which does not depend on this
 * service having heard anything.
 *
 * <p>The consequence was the worst-ordered one available. The portal has already erased every
 * meme, comment and collection by the time it announces PORTAL_CONTENT_PURGED. Lose that
 * announcement and the saga sits STARTED until {@code compensateOverdue} unlocks the account and
 * sends an apology — so the user keeps an account with nothing in it, {@code ACCOUNT_DELETED}
 * never goes out, and the {@code LOG.error} written for precisely this case
 * ("CONTENT ERASED AFTER COMPENSATION") never fires, because from this side nothing went wrong.
 *
 * <p>So: retry with a growing delay, and commit the offset ONLY after the record is through
 * ({@link OffsetStrategy#SYNC} — micronaut's retry strategies are inert while offsets
 * auto-commit). Redelivery is safe by construction: the claim on the outcome id is taken inside
 * the same transaction as the work, so a rollback releases it and a replay is a first attempt
 * again. If the retries are exhausted the container STOPS rather than skips — an unread outcome
 * that a restart will replay beats a silently discarded one, and a stopped listener is visible.
