     * Retention: a SETTLED row is deleted once it is older than the cutoff.
     *
     * <p>Nothing ever deleted from this table — a drained row was stamped and kept. Every row
     * carries the subject's address twice, as {@code event_key} AND inside the payload, so the
     * table was in effect a permanent register of every address ever registered: the
     * verification mail, the reset mail, the deletion fact with its purge choices. A user who
     * exercised their right to be forgotten had their address deleted from {@code users} and left
     * here for good, which is the same prize in a database dump that
     * {@link ExpiredSessionReaper} was written to stop handing over.
     *
     * <p>Both terminal states go: {@code published_at} (handed to the broker) and {@code failed_at}
     * (given up on permanently, V19). A row still awaiting the drain has NULL in both, and
     * {@code NULL < :cutoff} is unknown rather than true — so an undrained event is never swept, no
     * matter how old it is. That is the property that matters here: retention must not become a
     * silent second way to lose an event.
