/**
 * A law, in the spirit of ADR 0006: every HTTP entry point is CLASSIFIED — it either sits behind a
 * step-up, or it is exempt for a reason written down here.
 *
 * <p>P18 found the family this closes. {@code docs/mfa-design.md} declared the step-up phase DONE
 * and named enrolment, factor removal and password change as covered; the code had it on exactly
 * one endpoint. Nothing failed, because nothing was checking — a promise in a design document is
 * not a mechanism. This test is the mechanism: add a controller and the build asks you which of the
 * two things it is, before anyone has to notice.
 *
 * <p>What "sensitive" means here is narrow and testable: the request, made with nothing but a LIVE
 * SESSION, changes what it takes to sign in later, or hands out a durable new way in. That is the
 * shape of a stolen session turning itself into permanent access, and the shape step-up exists to
 * stop. Reading data, ending a session, or anything that already demands a secret the thief does
 * not have (the current password, a token mailed to an address they do not control) is exempt.
