/**
 * The guard on the guards: <b>skipping a pact verification is allowed only when the consumer
 * workspace is genuinely absent.</b>
 *
 * <p>This service is the PROVIDER for two contracts — the {@code GET /me} introspection that
 * memes' authorisation gate reads, and the {@code ACCOUNT_DELETION_REQUESTED} fact offboarding
 * opens sagas on. Both provider tests carry an {@code @EnabledIf} so a lone checkout of this repo
 * does not fail a build over a directory that was never cloned. That guard is reasonable and it is
 * also exactly how both verifications died: the estate split into three workspaces on 2026-07-12,
 * the consumers moved to {@code portal/}, and the paths kept pointing at {@code shared/}. The
 * directory stopped existing, {@code @EnabledIf} did its job, and JUnit reported SKIPPED — which
 * reads green. A breaking change to the shape of {@code /me} would have passed a full
 * {@code mvn test} of this service without a single red mark, for as long as nobody looked.
 *
 * <p>So the skip needs a witness. If the consumer IS checked out and the provider test still
 * cannot find its pacts, that is a stale path rather than a lone checkout, and it fails HERE
 * instead of hiding. This class carries no {@code @EnabledIf} of its own on purpose: it has to run
 * in every layout, so that the one thing it can prove — "nothing is being skipped for the wrong
 * reason" — is proven on every run. Modelled on the test of the same name in memes.
