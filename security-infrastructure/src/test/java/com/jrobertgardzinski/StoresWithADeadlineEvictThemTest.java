/**
 * A law, in the spirit of ADR 0006: every store that keeps state in a map is CLASSIFIED — either
 * what it holds has a deadline and something removes it when the deadline passes, or its entries
 * live as long as the account they belong to and a timer removing them would be a bug.
 *
 * <p>P18 poz. 17 found ONE of these growing without a bound. Finding it was luck: nothing
 * distinguished it from its neighbours, and its neighbours had exactly the same shape. Asking the
 * question of every store at once turned up five more — including a table whose expiry was enforced
 * only when READING it, so the rows piled up while every decision still looked right.
 *
 * <p>The classification is the useful part, and it follows how the bean is WIRED, which the test
 * cannot check but you can read here:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #PRODUCTION_WITH_A_DEADLINE} — wired UNCONDITIONALLY. These run in production, in
 *       front of endpoints a stranger can reach, and hold something that stops mattering at a known
 *       moment. An unbounded one is a defect, not untidiness: whoever can reach the endpoint decides
 *       how fast it grows.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #MIRRORS_A_REAPED_TABLE} — wired {@code @Requires(missingBeans = DataSource.class)}:
 *       the database's stand-in where none is configured. The table it mirrors has a reaper, so the
 *       twin sweeps too. Not because a dev instance will run out of memory, but because a twin that
 *       quietly behaves differently from the real thing is how a test proves something that is not
 *       true of production.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #LIVES_WITH_THE_ACCOUNT} — entries die with the account and not a moment sooner. A
 *       timer here would delete people's factors.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #CAPTURE_BUFFERS} — not stores at all: they exist so a test can assert on what would
 *       have been sent. Keeping everything IS the feature.</li>
 * </ul>
