// Where this page's security service lives, in the order the answer may be given:
//
//  1. window.SECURITY_URL — injected at RUNTIME. The e2e harness sets it before the app boots
//     (Playwright), and a deployment can serve a one-line /ui-config.js that does the same, which
//     is how one built bundle serves more than one environment.
//  2. VITE_SECURITY_URL — baked in at BUILD time for a deployment that would rather bake it.
//  3. the compose stack's address, which is what a human on the dev server wants.
//
// It used to be (1) or the hardcoded default, so a production bundle silently pointed at
// localhost:8080 — nothing consumed dist/ yet, which is the only reason that was not an outage.

// The relying-party id this deployment's passkeys live under — the server's
// security.webauthn.rp-id, answered the same way SECURITY is (runtime injection, then build time).
// Empty means "the page's own domain", which is the right answer whenever the two agree and the
// only answer the browser can work out for itself.
