/**
 * The ceiling on failures from ONE address against ANY account, inside the same window that
 * {@link MaxFailures} uses for a single account.
 *
 * <p>It exists because the tight per-account limit can be walked around: three guesses on each of a
 * thousand accounts is three thousand guesses from one address without ever reaching a per-account
 * limit — password spraying, and the shape an attacker moves to the moment the per-account count
 * starts working. This is the number that notices it.
 *
 * <p>Its default is deliberately far above {@link MaxFailures}: an address is not a person. Behind
 * one there may be an office, a CGNAT, or a CI runner creating accounts by the dozen, and a value
 * chosen for a single account's password would lock all of them out over somebody else's typos —
 * which is exactly what this project's own test suite proved by blocking itself halfway through a
 * run.
