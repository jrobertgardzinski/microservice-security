 * recorded that a code had been used, so the same six digits kept working for up to a minute and a
 * half. That is the difference between a possession factor and a shouted password: anyone who sees
 * the code (over a shoulder, in a phishing relay, in a screenshot) has the rest of the window to
 * use it, beside the owner rather than instead of them.
 *
 * <p>Not durable on purpose, like the other short-lived MFA state: losing it means a code could be
 * replayed across a restart, which is a much smaller window than the one it closes.
