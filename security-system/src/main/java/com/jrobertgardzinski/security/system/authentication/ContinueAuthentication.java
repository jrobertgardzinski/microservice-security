/**
 * Drives a sign-in that is past link #1 through its remaining factors, one proof at a time. Lives
 * in the authentication package so it can mint the session through the same {@link _GenerateSession}
 * the password path uses — the session is identical however the chain was walked. A wrong proof
 * costs an attempt (and folds into brute-force accounting at the boundary, like a wrong password);
 * running out, or an unknown/expired ticket, ends the attempt.
