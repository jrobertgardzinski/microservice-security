/**
 * Completes an email change: a matching, unused token applies the pending change (moving the user
 * to the new address); an unknown or already-used token is rejected. The new address is marked
 * verified — the change token was delivered there, which is the same ownership proof the regular
 * verification flow provides (and sign-in requires a verified address). Federated links FOLLOW the
 * account: they are keyed by the provider's durable subject (the same person, the same Google
 * account), so they are re-pointed at the new address — severing them would orphan the identity,
 * because the provider keeps reporting its own old address and the auto-link at the next sign-in
 * would never find the moved account.
 *
 * <p>A ticket is only good for as long as the window the caller sets: this link MOVES the account,
 * so one sitting unnoticed in an old mailbox must stop working, exactly as a password-reset link
 * does. It did not, until now — nothing was reading the date it was issued, because nothing was
 * stored.
 *
 * <p>Everything else the account owns is keyed by that address too, and not one of those tables has
 * a foreign key to cascade — so this use case moves them by hand or the move loses them. Two kinds,
 * two answers. What belongs to the ACCOUNT follows it: the MFA factors, the recovery codes and the
 * passwordless mark. Left behind, a lookup under the new address finds nothing, so the second factor
 * disappears without a trace and a password alone signs in again; and a federated account reads as
 * "has a password" under its new address, which locks its owner out of ever deleting it. What was
 * E-MAILED TO THE OLD ADDRESS is dropped instead: a pending reset, a pending further change, the
 * verification row. The account no longer owns that mailbox, and a live token pointing at a freed
 * address sets the password of whoever registers it next.
 *
 * <p>SESSIONS are neither moved nor kept: they are revoked, the same price a password change and a
 * password reset already charge. They cannot be moved, because a session remembers only the address
 * it was minted for — so a surviving one keeps authorizing as the OLD address, "sign out everywhere"
 * under the new address never reaches it, and the moment somebody registers the freed address that
 * session starts resolving to THEIR account: their roles, their session list. The owner signs in
 * again after moving; nobody inherits a session by taking over an abandoned address.
 *
 * <p>The address is checked for an occupant before anything moves, and the move itself is still
 * allowed to refuse: the window between requesting a change and following the link is up to a day
 * wide and nothing reserves the target, so somebody may register it in the meantime. Either way the
 * answer is {@link ConfirmEmailChangeResult.EmailTaken} and nothing has been moved — the stores
 * that follow the account are touched only once the move is known to be possible.
 *
 * <p>A ticket is also refused while the account is being DELETED. The deletion saga locks the
 * account and then waits for other services; a change landing in that window moves the locked user
 * to the new address, where the saga's compensation and its completion can no longer find them —
 * an account locked forever under an address its owner never finished moving to.
