 * attempts from one {@link IpAddress} in a rolling {@code window}. Registration hashes a password
 * with Argon2 and creates accounts; the reset-password and verify-email requests mint tokens and
 * send mails — unthrottled, each is a CPU-exhaustion, mass-signup or mail-bomb vector. One
 * instance guards one endpoint (each gets its own window and cap), so a burst against one cannot
 * starve another. A fixed window in memory; the source is the spoof-resistant IP the resolver
 * already trusts. Deliberately separate from the authentication guard: that one defends accounts
 * against password guessing, this one defends the service against volume.
